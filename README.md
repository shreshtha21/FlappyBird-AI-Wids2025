  <em>Welcome to the Winter in Data Science Program!</em><br>
  We are going to delve into the fascinating world of <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>  
  and learn how to maximise a Flappy Bird agent’s performance using Q-Learning.

This README will guide you through the resources, code, and structure of this repository so you can smoothly follow along and build your own RL-powered Flappy Bird agent.

## Week 1 — Foundations

In **Week-1**, we'll dive into the essential fundamentals needed before implementing RL:

- **Python Basics**  
  (functions, loops, data structures, classes, file handling)

- **NumPy**  
  (arrays, vectorized operations, random numbers, saving & loading data)

- **Matplotlib**  
  (creating plots, visualising training curves)

- **PyGame**
  (for later weeks)

These resources and practice scripts will prepare you for building the Flappy Bird environment and implementing Q-Learning in later weeks.
