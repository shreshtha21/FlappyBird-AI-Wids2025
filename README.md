Week 1: Focused on building programming foundations using Python. Covered Python basics, 
NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for data visualization, and PyGame fundamentals
including the game loop, event handling, basic physics, and rendering. This week prepared 
the groundwork required for implementing a custom game environment.

Week 2: Focused on Reinforcement Learning environment design. Studied Markov Decision 
Processes (MDPs) and formally defined the state space, action space, reward function, and 
termination conditions. Implemented a Flappy Bird–style environment with a Markov state 
representation (bird_y, bird_velocity, distance_to_pipe, gap_offset) and validated the 
environment using random policies. No reinforcement learning algorithms were trained up to 
the midterm.

Week 3: Focused on turning on the learning process. Studied value functions, Temporal 
Difference (TD) learning, and implemented tabular Q-learning. Learned the concepts of 
exploration vs exploitation using epsilon-greedy strategies, and analyzed the effect of 
hyperparameters such as learning rate and discount factor. Implemented training loops with 
episodes, distinguished between training and evaluation modes, and studied convergence 
behavior and common failure modes in Q-learning.
